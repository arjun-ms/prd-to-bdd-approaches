# Approach 4: LLM-Based Duplicate Checking

## Overview

This approach uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to intelligently identify and remove duplicate BDD scenarios. It leverages the LLM's natural language understanding to make nuanced decisions about what constitutes a true duplicate while preserving important test variations.

## Methodology

### 1. **Batch Processing**
- Processes scenarios in configurable batches (default: 50 scenarios)
- Avoids token limits and maintains context quality
- Each batch is independently analyzed

### 2. **Intelligent Duplicate Detection**
The LLM is instructed to:
- Identify scenarios describing the **same behavior** (even with different wording)
- **Preserve** opposite outcomes (success vs. error)
- **Preserve** different user roles or permissions
- **Preserve** input variations (valid vs. invalid)
- **Preserve** edge cases and boundary conditions
- **Preserve** same feature with different preconditions

### 3. **Structured Output**
```json
{
  "features": [/* kept scenarios */],
  "removed": [
    {
      "given": "...",
      "when": "...",
      "then": "...",
      "reason": "Duplicate of scenario X - same behavior"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Low Temperature Setting**
- Uses `temperature=0.1` for consistent, deterministic decisions
- Reduces randomness in duplicate detection

## Advantages

✅ **Human-Like Understanding**: Best semantic comprehension of duplicates  
✅ **Context-Aware**: Understands test intent, not just wording  
✅ **Automatic**: No manual threshold tuning required  
✅ **Explainable**: Provides reasons for removal decisions  
✅ **Preserves Variations**: Intelligently keeps important edge cases  
✅ **Flexible**: Adapts to different domains without configuration  
✅ **No Training Required**: Works out-of-the-box  

## Disadvantages

❌ **API Costs**: Most expensive approach (multiple LLM calls)  
❌ **Slower**: Takes longer than embedding-based methods  
❌ **Rate Limits**: May hit API rate limits on large PRDs  
❌ **Non-Deterministic**: Small variations possible between runs  
❌ **Requires Internet**: Cannot run offline  
❌ **Token Limits**: Must batch process large datasets  

## When to Use This Approach

### ✅ Best For:
- Complex PRDs with nuanced requirements
- When accuracy is more important than cost
- Projects with budget for API calls
- Scenarios where manual review is expensive
- When explanation of decisions is needed
- Final quality pass before production

### ❌ Avoid When:
- Tight budget constraints
- Very large PRDs (>2000 scenarios)
- Need for offline processing
- Real-time or high-frequency processing
- Deterministic results are critical

## Understanding LLM Decisions

### What Gets Removed

**Example 1: True Duplicate**
```json
// REMOVED
{
  "given": "user is logged in",
  "when": "they click logout",
  "then": "session ends",
  "reason": "Duplicate of scenario 3 - same logout behavior"
}

// KEPT (Original)
{
  "given": "authenticated user",
  "when": "logout button clicked",
  "then": "user session terminated"
}
```

**Example 2: Preserved Variation**
```json
// KEPT - Both preserved (opposite outcomes)
{
  "when": "valid credentials submitted",
  "then": "login succeeds"
}
{
  "when": "invalid credentials submitted",
  "then": "login fails"
}
```
